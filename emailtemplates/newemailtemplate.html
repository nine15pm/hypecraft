                <p class="story-text-light">Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has acknowledged that the team needs Sergio Perez to regain his form amidst the growing threat from Ferrari and McLaren. Perez has struggled in recent races, including a "brutal" Monaco GP weekend where he qualified 16th and crashed on the first lap. Horner emphasized that Red Bull needs both cars scoring points, as Ferrari and McLaren are closing in on the Constructors' Championship. "We just need to get him back into that position of confidence and not see a dip," Horner said. The team's lead over Ferrari has been reduced to 24 points, and Perez has dropped to fifth in the Drivers' Championship.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Lewis Hamilton's final season with Mercedes has not gone as planned, with the seven-time world champion currently eighth in the drivers' championship behind teammate George Russell. Hamilton has failed to finish in the top five in a race and hasn't won since the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix in December 2021. He has only outqualified Russell once and beaten him once when both drivers have seen the chequered flag. Hamilton has expressed frustration with his one-lap pace, saying "I don't understand... I'm just lacking" and "I don't anticipate being ahead of George in Qualifying this year." Team principal Toto Wolff has acknowledged Hamilton's frustration, saying "All drivers are a bit sceptical at times" and that the team is "trying to maximise the results for Hamilton's final season." With 16 events remaining, there is still time for Hamilton to turn his season around.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Renault CEO Luca de Meo is considering abandoning the company's F1 engine project, potentially selling the team, and is reportedly shopping for an engine supply for 2026. This could lead to the Alpine brand being retained through a naming and livery rights deal. De Meo is also linked to appointing Flavio Briatore, a controversial figure in F1, as a special advisor to the team, sparking concerns due to his past involvement in the 2008 'Crashgate' scandal. Meanwhile, Carlos Sainz's future is uncertain, with Williams potentially offering him a better deal.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Max Verstappen has expressed frustration with Red Bull's ongoing struggles with bump weakness, stating that the team "clearly doesn't understand" the issue that has plagued them since last season. Despite dominating in previous years, the RB19's weakness on kerbs and bumps has been exposed in recent races, including Monaco, Miami, and Melbourne. Verstappen believes it's a fundamental problem that won't be fixed quickly, saying "we need to understand what it is, because we clearly don't understand it." He warns that upcoming races, such as the Canadian Grand Prix, may be challenging for the team, but is hopeful that they can make progress and improve their performance by next year.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff has denied favoritism towards Lewis Hamilton over George Russell, saying the team treats both drivers equally and transparently. This comes after Hamilton expressed doubts about outqualifying Russell for the rest of the season, citing a performance drop-off in qualifying. However, Wolff attributes Hamilton's comments to a competitive mindset, and both drivers will receive a new front wing upgrade at the next race in Canada. As Wolff stated, 'We are trying to always balance it right, and be transparent and fair.'</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Josef Newgarden, the Indianapolis 500 winner, claims that IndyCar drivers could "rock" Formula 1, stating "any of us could, and we would rock it." While he likely means the championship's frontrunners, Newgarden acknowledges the immense pressure and challenge of making it to F1, citing the need to indoctrinate oneself into the system, secure funding, and overcome political hurdles. The article assesses the arguments for and against IndyCar drivers succeeding in F1, including their potential to adapt to different cars and tracks, as well as the differences in competition and spotlight intensity between the two series. Newgarden's claim is supported by the performances of Alex Palou and Pato O'Ward in FP1 outings, but countered by the struggles of IndyCar drivers in support series and the specialized nature of F1.</p>

                <p class="paragraph">Formula 1 drivers, including Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso, are calling for a change to the red-flag tyre rule, which they feel eliminated strategic excitement at the Monaco Grand Prix. The rule allows drivers to change tyres under a red flag, making mandatory pitstops and strategic plays unnecessary. Verstappen and Alonso suggest alternatives, such as not changing tyres or being obliged to use the same tyre under a red flag. Meanwhile, Red Bull's advisor Helmut Marko is pushing for Monaco circuit improvements, including possible mandatory pit stops or required use of all three tyre compounds to increase strategy and overtaking opportunities.</p>
